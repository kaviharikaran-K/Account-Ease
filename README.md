# Account-Ease
This C++ program models a simple banking system using object-oriented programming. It defines a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and display functions, and a SavingsAccount subclass that adds interest calculation. The main function provides a menu-driven interface for users to manage their account interactively.
